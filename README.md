## DShot ESP32 Library utilizing RMT

This is a fork of the [`DrGlaucous/DShotRMT_NEO`](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/DShotRMT_NEO) repository. The fork was made to remove the dependency on [`DrGlaucous/esp-rmt-NEO`](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/esp-rmt-NEO), which causes compilation errors when using a framework based on ESP-IDF version 5.0.0 or higher. 

Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/DrGlaucous/DShotRMT_NEO) for more information.
